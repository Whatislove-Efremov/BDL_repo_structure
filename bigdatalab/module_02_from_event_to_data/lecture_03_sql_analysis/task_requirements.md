# Task Requirements

## Lecture: SQL Analysis and Data Processing

### Homework Description
In this homework assignment, students must implement SQL scripts based strictly on the task descriptions.
The goal is to reinforce the concepts covered in the lecture through practical SQL exercises.
Tasks are divided into 2 parts:
1. Two small lessons after each topic.
2. A comprehensive ETL script after completing the entire SQL section, for analyzing and processing data using SQL.

### Requirements
- Solutions must precisely match the task formulation.
- All necessary queries, calculations, and outputs must be implemented.
- Scripts should produce expected results.
- Only concepts covered in the current lecture should be used.
- If tasks specify additional constraints (e.g., specific operators or constructs), they must be followed.

### Submission Guidelines
- Submit SQL files with the ".sql" extension.
- Scripts must execute without errors.
- Output must match the expected format.
- Do not include unnecessary functions that are not required for the task.
